# Chang's Tools, Workflow and Tips

## OS:
Windows -> linux -> OSX

I was a Mac-hater for the longest time, but edge cases in Windows was making me pull my hair out, and running Photoshop/Illustrator on Linux was messy.

## Snacks:  
- Oranges
- Clementines
- Mechanically separated chicken

## Productivity music: 

- [Red Army Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxcP7TRY178)
- [North Korean Military Marches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq54msMu3Sc)
- [Glitch Mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-k_Eg7zXuc)

## Git

- Get a GUI. Even if you're a command line wiz, try it for a week.  
  I tried [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) for 2 weeks, bought a licence, not going back.  
  [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) also comes highly recommended.
- Try to keep PRs under 500 lines of code, otherwise difficult to review.  
- "Cherry Picking" commits between branches is quite useful

- Check your diffs before committing

## Sublime Text 3

- `"draw_white_space": "all"`  
  not pretty at first, but you get used to it in a day
- Theme: [Centurion](https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion)  
  no file icons, but tabs are the right size for me
- Color Scheme: [Tomorrow-Night](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme)
